# Sign-language-to-text-convertor-app
Sign language  to text convertor can convert ASL (American Sign Language) to pure english text in real time. It uses MP holistic to extract key points and that data is fed to the LSTM model and the model is trained. 
The python notebook contains the code for dataset colection , training and testing. We have already trained the model using our own dataset and the model is saved as action.h5

Steps to run the trained model:
1. Install all the necessary dependencies: ```!pip install tensorflow==2.4.1 tensorflow-gpu==2.4.1 opencv-python mediapipe sklearn matplotlib```
2. In the python notebook only run the cells numbered 1-12 to load the trained model
3. Run the cell immediately below the 12th cell, which will open the application window
